    <h1>Cloud Resume Challenge Blog Post</h1>

    <p>In completing the Cloud Resume Challenge for my Networking and Cloud Computing Class at Loyola Marymount University, I have been able to gain experience in a variety of areas. 
      First and foremost, my familiarity with Amazon Web Services and the depth and versatility of their cloud offerings has grown immensely throughout the experience. 
      Through our class discussions, technical labs, and many, many helpful tutorial videos provided by our professor, I’ve been able to get a good general grasp of how AWS has become the one stop shop for all things in the cloud, from setting up domains on the internet, to connecting APIs throughout websites, to securing one’s servers and data from external threats, and much more. 
      Additionally, the project has piqued my interest in cloud computing and potentially working towards earning my AWS certification in the near future. 
      After using such a versatile service and getting an idea of how profound AWS’ impact is across so many industries in terms of sustaining operations worth trillions of dollars 24/7, with as minimal of issues as possible, it seems more than logical to make sure that I’m trained on the subject. 
      For now, however, I will be presenting some of the experience I’ve gained using specific AWS services throughout this project.
    </p><br>

    <p>To begin, our work with AWS started with understanding the use of and need for configuring user privileges when it comes to managing resources on the cloud. 
      The “least privilege principle” was instilled in our heads as the default, industry standard approach to setting up the user hierarchy for any enterprise level resource, be it on AWS or any other provider. 
      In terms of efficiency and security of such a system, this principle makes intuitive sense as delegating certain powers to certain users in order to ensure that there are conflicting redundancies in user capabilities, such as a base-level analyst having the ability to delete or modify the privileges of their manager, for example. 
      Additionally, we incorporated multi-factor authentication as an additional, yet increasingly-necessary security measure to keep our resources safe from external threats looking to exploit weak systems.
      </p><br>

    <p>Our next focus was AWS’ EC2 service, providing virtual servers in the cloud. 
      EC2’s real world use was obvious as it provides individuals and/or companies with access to virtual servers able to process their data and, therefore, run their operations, without having to invest in costly physical server hardware and maintenance. 
      EC2 encompasses AWS’ bread and butter in the sense that its value to customers comes from its high-scalability, cost-efficiency, off-premise nature, and security. 
      We were able to sign up for the free tier since the project calls for very minimal server usage, especially compared to many of the big industry players that rely on AWS. 
      It was very exciting to learn about how much more efficient cloud computing is as an alternative to constructing and maintaining a private, on-premises server system, which has truly revolutionized the IT industry for the better. 
      Additionally, we were able to gain experience in using the CLI instead of manually setting up EC2 instances through the normal GUI. 
      This was insightful because it showed the ease of scalability across AWS where hundreds of virtual servers could be created by just writing a few lines of code.
      </p><br>

    <p>Our next focus was on S3, which provides virtual storage in the cloud. 
      Similar to EC2, S3 is highly scalable and can be very cost-efficient for users since they only pay for what they use in a given period of time. 
      On S3, I created buckets to manage the storage of the files composing my website, such as my resume template, as well as my visitorCounter API. 
      In this section it was important to learn about naming conventions, as well as the use of policy generators to aid in setting up user privileges and access.
      </p><br> 

    <p>The most difficult part of the project to wrap my head around was setting up the Cloud Delivery Network via CloudFront. 
      The complexity of the Domain Name System and how each website has a specific naming structure, with each segment having its own technical significance was slightly frightening to unpack. 
      While I am still somewhat confused on how exactly DNS works and what ultimate purpose it serves, I understand it to be crucial in translating IP addresses to their corresponding website domains around the internet. 
      Furthermore, the concept of caching content was new to me, but somewhat understandable as a means to make data easily available across the internet by storing versions of it, periodically updated. 
      However, the idea of the “edge” is still somewhat unclear to me.
    </p><br>

    <p>Finally, creating our own API via Lambda and API Gateway was a good experience because I was able to visualize how API’s are easily deployed on websites, like they are on most sites these days. 
      It was helpful to see how these API’s are constructed using Javascript, and I personally would have liked to have more experience in this area during my time as an ISBA major at LMU. 
      In my opinion, the ability to create one’s own API’s for whatever purpose seems very exciting and versatile, so I wish there was more focus on that in the curriculum.
      </p><br> 

    <p>All in all, the Cloud Resume Challenge was a great experience for me and really helped me visualize how all the different parts and pieces of running a website and servers come together. 
      While originally the project seemed daunting, I am grateful for our professor’s help and guidance, as well as my class peers, always willing to help pick at problems and brainstorm solutions for whatever issue we come across. 
      I am happy to present my Cloud Resume!
